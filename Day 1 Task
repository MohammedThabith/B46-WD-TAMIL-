         *HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.                          *while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
         *It usest works on the textual format.                                           *It works on the binary protocol.
         *It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.              *It use push frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
         *It compresses data by itself.                                                   *It uses Hpack for data compression.
         *There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind              *It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
         it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

Question 2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
Answer :

         *Here the objects are most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
         *The object() function returns an empty object. You cannot add new properties or methods to this object.
         *Advantages of Objects :
            -Objects Can Encapsulate Operations Along with Data.
            -Objects Are Efficient.
            -Objects Can Represent Part-Whole Relationships.
        *objects may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types.
        *object representation is the Visual object representation is the process of encoding object information in 
         visual cortex for purposes of object identification, discrimination, evaluation, and memory storage.
